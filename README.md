# Climate Predictor
This is a small webpage that allows the user to input a location and a weather statistic to monitor over a specified range of time and get a graph of the results. Usage is fairly self-explanatory.

# Installation and Usage
The tool is just a webpage with no build tools. All you need to do is spin up a web server and point it at the root directory of this repo.
